Maze Wars
By Brian Legarth

To start the game type 'python main.py' into the terminal and the game window 
will pop up. Then click on either the E for easy, M for medium, or H for hard.
This will begin the initial building phase you will have as long as you want
to create any maze you can with the money you have. Once you are ready to
start the game you press the spacebar and the level will begin. Once you
finish a level press the e key to start a new level.

Controls:
Click on any square to select it, either a build menu or an upgrade menu will
pop up. If the build menu pops up, you can either select the triangle (short
tower), the diamond (long tower), the heart (special tower), or the cancel 
button (left arrow). If the upgrade menu pops up, you can either select the 
upgrade button (up arrow) or the cancel button (left arrow).

****************BUG*******************
If you pause the game it makes it so the next enemy does not
spawn at the right time and may spawn in close proximity to
the previous enemy

Sometimes if you build a tower while the enemy is crossing
into the last red square the new path will break the game
because the newest checkpoint for the enemy that crossed
the finish line doesn't exist.
